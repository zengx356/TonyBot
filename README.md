# Uwu-Chatbot

A chatbot that uses machine learning to learn how to have a conversation with someone. As it evolves, it will take sentences and replace some parts with the very common phase: 'uwu'. This will eventually become an uwu chatbot.

Some of the technologies that I have used to create this is Python, Tensorflow, and Anaconda. 

# TODO
* Gather data preferably in a CSV file as opposed to JSON for ease of access and use in storing conversation data
* Implement uwu bot
* Make bot more intelligent through more scientific data
* Implement this bot as a discord bot
