# TonyBot

A simple chatbot that uses hardcoded data to spout information about myself. This will be the basis for a discord server bot. The bot will read in a JSON file and process the data from it. From there we will split the data into a training set and train the model so that it will be able to chat back to the user.

Some of the technologies that I have used to create this is Python, Tensorflow, Anaconda, Discord. 

# TODO
* Give more data to bot to use
* Implement this bot as a discord bot
